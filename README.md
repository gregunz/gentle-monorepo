## This is a gentle Python monorepo template
Inspired by [The Gentle Monorepo](https://pretalx.com/pydata-amsterdam-2025/talk/XYZ) talk at PyData Amsterdam 2025, based of this [template](https://github.com/davidvujic/python-polylith-example-uv).

## What's this? ðŸ¤”
This is a monorepo template for Python projects.
It follows the **Polylith Architecture** and focuses on:
- Reusing components across multiple products
- Fast, reproducible dependency management
- Trust-based, lightweight collaboration

## Tooling ðŸ› 
- **Polylith** â†’ structure & modularity
- **uv** â†’ dependency management

## Why?
To iterate faster, share more, and avoid the pain of managing internal packages in separate repos.
